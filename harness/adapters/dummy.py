TEMPLATE = """### Topology
single-stage (uncertain); treating as differential pair with mirror load.

### Assumptions
- single dominant pole; unity-gain context; external CL

### Key relation
GBW â‰ˆ gm/CL under the above assumptions.

### Grounded evidence
- cites: {cite1}, {cite2}

### Answer
GBW is set by gm/CL; exceptions like feedforward/current-steering change the relation. CMFB loop should be slower and compensated at its amp when present.
