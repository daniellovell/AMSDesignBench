Designing a Single-Ended Telescopic High-Swing OTA

Essentials:
- Single-ended telescopic cascode stack with biasing that enables larger output swing (e.g., reduced V* on certain devices or separate bias rails).
- NMOS differential pair with tails; PMOS cascodes to VDD.
- Bodies: NMOS→0, PMOS→VDD.

Synthesis guidance:
- Provide a SPICE-like netlist (placeholders ok) and clearly indicate high-swing intent in structure.
