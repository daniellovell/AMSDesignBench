Designing a Single-Ended Telescopic Cascode OTA

Essentials:
- Single-ended output branch (e.g., vop) formed by stacked NMOS and PMOS devices.
- NMOS differential pair with NMOS tail; NMOS cascode(s) above, PMOS cascode/load up to VDD.
- Bodies tied appropriately (NMOS→0, PMOS→VDD).

Synthesis guidance:
- Provide a minimal SPICE-like netlist with placeholder W/L and clear single-ended output.
