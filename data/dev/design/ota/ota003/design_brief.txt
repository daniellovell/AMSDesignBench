Design a single‑stage current‑mirror OTA with a high‑swing output path with NMOS differential input pair.
The design should have gain bandwidth equal to gm/CL times the current mirror ratio.
Output swing should be from V* of the NMOS on the low side to VDD - V* of the PMOS on the high side.
Include the supply (VDD) and load capacitance.
