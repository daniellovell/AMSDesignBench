# Common rubric variables for ota003.
topology_target: High-Swing Current Mirror OTA
topology_rejects: 5-Transistor (5T) OTA, Telescopic Cascode, Two-Stage, Folded Cascode, Single-Stage Common Source, Gain-Boosted Cascode
relation_equivalents: Mathematically equivalent forms are acceptable, but must preserve the current mirror gain factor k (e.g., g_m/C_L*k = k*g_m/C_L)
