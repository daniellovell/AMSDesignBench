# Common rubric variables for ota004.
topology_target: Two-Stage (Miller) OTA
topology_rejects: 5-Transistor (5T) OTA, Telescopic Cascode, Current Mirror OTA, Folded Cascode, Single-Stage Common Source, Single-Stage OTAs, Gain-Boosted Cascode
relation_equivalents: Mathematically equivalent forms are acceptable for two-stage expressions (e.g., g_m1*g_m6*(r_o2||r_o4)/C_L = g_m1*g_m6*r_o2*r_o4/(C_L*(r_o2+r_o4)))
