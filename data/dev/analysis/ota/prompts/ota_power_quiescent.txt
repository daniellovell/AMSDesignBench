You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, answer the question about quiescent power consumption for the given circuit.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Key relation
- Device identification
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements. Identify single-ended vs differential OTA.
- In Key relation: give the symbolic relation for quiescent power: P_quiescent = VDD Ã— I_device, where I_device is the DC current through SPECIFIC device(s).
- In Device identification: EXPLICITLY identify which specific device(s) (by their IDs like M1, M2, etc.) carry the quiescent current.
- In Grounded evidence: cite specific device IDs from the artifact.
- In Answer: provide the final power expression using SPECIFIC device current(s).
- Avoid generic statements without conditions.
