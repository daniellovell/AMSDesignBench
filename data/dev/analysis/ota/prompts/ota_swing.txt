Analyze the output swing limits and headroom budgets near the power rails.

**Required Analysis**:
1. **Output swing limits**: State the maximum and minimum output voltages the circuit can achieve
2. **Headroom budgets**: Identify voltage headroom needed at each rail to maintain proper device operation
3. **Operating conditions**: Provide inequalities ensuring all devices remain in saturation

**Expected Format and Notation**:

Use symbolic expressions with the following conventions:

**Symbolic Notation**:
- Use "Vov" for overdrive voltage (Vov = Vgs - Vth), NOT "VDS(sat)" or raw threshold voltages
- Express swing limits in terms of Vov, NOT numeric estimates

**Device Naming**:
- Use device role names in expressions:
  * "M_in" or "input" for input/differential pair devices
  * "load" for active load devices
  * "cas" for cascode devices
  * "tail" for tail current source
- Example: "Vov_load" means overdrive of the load device
- Example: "Vov_M_in" means overdrive of the input device

**Format Example** (simple common-source stage):
```
High-side: VDD - Vov_load
Low-side: Vov_M_in
```

**Format Example** (cascode stage):
```
High-side: VDD - Vov_cas_p - Vov_load
Low-side: Vov_M_in + Vov_cas_n
```

**Additional Guidance**:
- Identify the limiting device(s) at each rail
- State saturation conditions (e.g., "Vov_load > 0", "VDS_M_in > Vov_M_in")
- Explain which device constrains each swing limit and why

**Grounding Requirement**:
Cite specific device IDs and node names from the artifact to support your analysis (e.g., M1, M2, vout, VDD, net names).
