You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, answer the question about unity-gain bandwidth (GBW) for the given two-stage circuit.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Key relation
- Device identification
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology (two-stage amplifier) and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements.
- In Key relation: give the symbolic relation for two-stage GBW (typically involves transconductance and compensation capacitor).
- In Device identification: identify the specific devices that determine GBW (input stage transconductance devices, compensation capacitor).
- In Grounded evidence: cite element IDs and nets from the artifact (e.g., `M1`, `M2`, `Cc`, `vout`).
- Avoid generic statements without conditions.
