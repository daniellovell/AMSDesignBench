You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, answer the question about the output-referred white thermal noise CURRENT for the given circuit.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Key relation
- Device identification
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements. Identify single-ended vs differential OTA.
- In Key relation: give the formula for output-referred thermal noise CURRENT. KEEP ALL PROCESS PARAMETERS SYMBOLIC (e.g., use γ, not 2/3).
- In Device identification: EXPLICITLY identify which specific devices (by their IDs like M1, M2, etc.) contribute to the output noise current. List their transconductances.
- In Grounded evidence: cite specific device IDs from the artifact and explain why each contributes.
- In Answer: provide the final output-referred noise CURRENT using SPECIFIC device transconductances and SYMBOLIC process parameters.
- Consider only white thermal noise sources (channel thermal noise), NOT flicker noise.
- Output should be in A²/Hz (amperes squared per hertz).
- Avoid generic statements without conditions.
