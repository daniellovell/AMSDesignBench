You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, answer the question about unity-gain bandwidth (GBW) for the given circuit.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Key relation
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements. Identify single-ended vs differential OTA.
- In Key relation: give the simplest symbolic relation that applies to this topology. 
- In Grounded evidence: cite element IDs and nets from the artifact (e.g., `M1`, `M2`, `Cload`, `vout`).
- Avoid generic statements without conditions.
