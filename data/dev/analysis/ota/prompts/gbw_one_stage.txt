You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, answer the question about unity-gain bandwidth (GBW) for the given circuit.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Assumptions
- Key relation
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology (e.g., single-stage, telescopic cascode, folded cascode, two-stage, high-swing mirror) and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements.
- In Key relation: give the simplest symbolic relation that applies to this topology. Include modifiers when topology demands it (e.g., current-mirror ratio k → GBW ≈ (gm/CL)·k). State conditions (unity-gain, dominant pole, etc.).
- In Grounded evidence: cite element IDs and nets from the artifact (e.g., `M1`, `M2`, `Cload`, `vout`).
- Avoid generic statements without conditions. Do not assume Miller/two-stage unless visible in the artifact.

Example (for format only — adapt to THIS circuit, do not copy):

## Topology
Single-stage differential pair with current-mirror load; high-swing path present at vout.

## Assumptions
Unity-gain use (β≈1), dominant pole at vout, devices in saturation.

## Key relation
GBW ≈ (gm/CL)·k, where k is the mirror ratio from the inner load to the output path. If no mirror scaling, GBW ≈ gm/CL.

## Grounded evidence
`M1`, `M2` form the input transconductor (gm); `Cload` at `vout`; mirror devices `M4/M6` connect load current to `vout`.

## Answer
Under unity-gain conditions with a dominant output pole, GBW is set by gm/CL (scaled by k if the output path mirrors the inner load).
