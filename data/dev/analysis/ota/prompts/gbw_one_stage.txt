You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, answer the question about unity-gain bandwidth (GBW) for the given circuit.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Assumptions
- Key relation
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology (e.g., single-stage, telescopic cascode, folded cascode, two-stage, high-swing mirror) and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements.
- In Key relation: give the simplest symbolic relation that applies to this topology. Include modifiers when topology demands it (e.g., current-mirror ratio k → GBW ≈ (gm/CL)·k). State conditions (unity-gain, dominant pole, etc.).
- In Grounded evidence: cite element IDs and nets from the artifact (e.g., `M1`, `M2`, `Cload`, `vout`).
- Avoid generic statements without conditions. Do not assume Miller/two-stage unless visible in the artifact.
