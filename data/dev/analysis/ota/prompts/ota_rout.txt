You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, determine the small-signal output resistance (r_out) for the given circuit at vout.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Assumptions
- Key relation
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology (e.g., single-stage, telescopic cascode, folded cascode, two-stage, high-swing mirror) and justify using observed devices.
- In Key relation: state r_out symbolically for this topology and the conditions for validity (matching, high ro, small-signal, etc.).
- In Grounded evidence: cite real element IDs/nets that set r_out at `vout` (e.g., devices tied to the output node).

Examples (for format only — pick the one that matches this circuit and adapt):

Example A — One-stage differential OTA with current-mirror load:
  r_out ≈ r_o/2 (half-circuit approximation with mirrored load). Conditions: symmetry, large ro.

Example B — Telescopic/folded cascode:
  r_out ≈ (gm·r_o^2)/2 per side, leading to higher output resistance; requires high ro and proper biasing.

Example C — High-swing mirror at vout:
  r_out ≈ r_op ∥ r_on (parallel of PMOS and NMOS output resistances tied to vout).
