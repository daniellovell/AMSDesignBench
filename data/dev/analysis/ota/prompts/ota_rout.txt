You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, determine the small-signal output resistance (r_out) for the given circuit at vout.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Key relation
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements. Identify single-ended vs differential OTA.
- In Key relation: state r_out symbolically for this topology and the conditions for validity (matching, high ro, small-signal, etc.).
- In Grounded evidence: cite real element IDs/nets that set r_out at `vout` (e.g., devices tied to the output node).
