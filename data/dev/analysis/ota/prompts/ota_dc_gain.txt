You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, answer the question about open-loop DC gain (A0) for the given circuit.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Key relation
- Device identification
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements. Identify single-ended vs differential OTA.
- In Key relation: give the symbolic relation for DC gain. Focus on the ORDER of the gain (e.g., gm*ro, (gm*ro)², (gm*ro)³). Constant multiplicative factors (like 1/2, 2, etc.) are acceptable and will not be penalized.
- In Device identification: EXPLICITLY identify which specific devices (by their IDs like M1, M2, etc.) contribute to the gain calculation.
- In Grounded evidence: cite specific device IDs from the artifact.
- In Answer: provide the final DC gain expression using SPECIFIC device IDs.
- Avoid generic statements without conditions.
