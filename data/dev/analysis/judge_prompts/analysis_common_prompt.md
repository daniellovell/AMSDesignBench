## Analysis Track Guidance

- Emphasize correctness of the key relation and conditions, grounded in the rubric and provided refs/inventory.
- Treat mathematically equivalent expressions as correct even if notation differs.
  - Examples: accept gm/CL, gm/C_L, gm/Cload, gm/C_{load}, and GBW = gm/(2π·CL) as equivalent to GBW = gm/(2 * π * CL); ignore spacing and minor symbolization (≈, ~, ~=).
- When `inventory.grounding_disabled` is true, do not penalize citations under “safety”; auto‑award any requires_grounding criteria.
- Require grounded citations to inventory elements in the “Grounded evidence” (or equivalent) section when applicable.
- Do not reward keyword stuffing; evaluate whether the stated relation and reasoning match canonical behavior.
