You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, identify the input and output signal modality of the given feedback amplifier circuit.

**IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION:** Assume the op-amp has a finite open-loop gain A0, infinite input impedance, and zero output impedance when analyzing the circuit.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Signal types
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the feedback topology and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements.
- In Signal types: identify whether the input is voltage or current, and whether the output is voltage or current.
- In Grounded evidence: cite circuit elements (e.g., input connection, output node, feedback network) showing the signal flow.

**IMPORTANT - Answer Format:**
- In Answer: express your answer in the format "X-Y" where X is the input signal type (V for voltage, I for current) and Y is the output signal type.
- Examples: "I-V" if input is current and output is voltage, "V-V" if both are voltages, "V-I" for voltage-to-current, "I-I" for current-to-current.
- You may also use descriptive format like "current-to-voltage" or "voltage-to-voltage".
