You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, derive the closed-loop DC gain expression from input to output for the given feedback amplifier circuit.

**IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION:** Assume the op-amp has a finite open-loop gain A0, infinite input impedance, and zero output impedance when deriving your expressions.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Key relation
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the feedback topology (TIA, inverting, noninverting, etc.) and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements.
- In Key relation: give the closed-loop gain expression (e.g., Vout/Vin, Vout/Iin) with proper signs and units.
- In Grounded evidence: cite element IDs (resistors, capacitors, opamp) and nets from the artifact.
- Avoid generic statements without conditions.

**IMPORTANT - Symbolic Expression Requirements:**
- You MUST provide a symbolic expression, not numeric values.
- Denote op-amp DC gain as A0 (or A(s) for frequency-dependent expressions).
- Denote component values using their element IDs from the circuit (e.g., R1, R2, C1, C2, etc.).
- Use standard algebraic notation without LaTeX formatting.
- Example formats: "Vout/Iin = -R1", "Vout/Vin = -(R1/R2)", "Vout/Vin = 1 + (R2/R1)"
