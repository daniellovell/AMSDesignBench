You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, determine the loop gain of the given feedback amplifier circuit.

**IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION:** Assume the op-amp has a finite open-loop gain A0, infinite input impedance, and zero output impedance when deriving your expressions.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Key relation
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the feedback topology and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements.
- In Key relation: state the loop gain expression T with the feedback factor beta fully expanded (e.g., T = A0 * R1/(R1+R2), NOT just T = A0 * beta). Include the actual component values.
- In Grounded evidence: cite element IDs and parameters from the artifact (e.g., opamp gain parameter, feedback network elements).
- Distinguish between loop gain and closed-loop gain.

**IMPORTANT - Symbolic Expression Requirements:**
- You MUST provide a symbolic expression, not numeric values.
- Denote op-amp gain as A0 for DC or A(s) for frequency-dependent expressions.
- Denote component values using their element IDs from the circuit (e.g., R1, R2, C1, C2, etc.).
- Use standard algebraic notation without LaTeX formatting.
- Example formats: "Loop gain T = A0", "Loop gain T = A0 * R1/(R1+R2)", "Loop gain T = A(s)"
