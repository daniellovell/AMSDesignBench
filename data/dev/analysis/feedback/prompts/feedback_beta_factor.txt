You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, identify the feedback factor beta for the given feedback amplifier circuit.

**IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION:** Assume the op-amp has a finite open-loop gain A0, infinite input impedance, and zero output impedance when analyzing the circuit.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Feedback factor
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the feedback topology and justify in 1 sentence using observed elements.
- In Feedback factor: derive the feedback factor beta, which is the fraction of the output signal fed back to the input. For voltage feedback, this is typically a resistor divider ratio.
- In Grounded evidence: cite element IDs and nets from the artifact that constitute the feedback network.
- The feedback factor beta should be dimensionless for voltage feedback or have appropriate units for current/transimpedance feedback.

**IMPORTANT - Symbolic Expression Requirements:**
- You MUST provide a symbolic expression, not numeric values.
- Denote component values using their element IDs from the circuit (e.g., R1, R2, C1, C2, etc.).
- Use standard algebraic notation without LaTeX formatting.
- Example formats: "beta = 1" (unity feedback), "beta = R1/(R1+R2)", "beta = R2/(R1+R2)"
- For transimpedance amplifiers (TIA), beta is typically 1 (unity feedback).
