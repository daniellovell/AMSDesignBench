weight_correctness: "0.10"
loop_gain_target: "T = A0 (also acceptable: Aol or A(s))."
loop_gain_disallowed: "Symbolic products like A0*beta without expanding beta."
loop_gain_guidance: "Accept open-loop gain labels (A0, Aol, A(s)) that represent the op-amp gain in the loop."
loop_gain_reject: "T = A0*beta; T = A(s)*beta; loop gain expressed as closed-loop result."
grounded_allowed_ids: "XU2, S_in, S_out, 0, Aol, GBW"

grounded_guidance: "Reference the amplifier element and its gain parameters (Aol, GBW) provided in the artifact."
correctness_reject: "Loop gain equated to -R1; loop gain describing closed-loop transimpedance."
correctness_guidance: "Deduct when the answer confuses loop gain with the closed-loop behavior."
