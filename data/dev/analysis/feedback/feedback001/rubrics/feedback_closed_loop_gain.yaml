weight_correctness: "0.10"
gain_expression_target: "Vout/Iin = -R1."
gain_expression_guidance: "Emphasize the transimpedance set by the feedback resistor and the negative sign from the inverting configuration."
gain_expression_reject: "Vout/Iin = R1; Vout/Iin = +R1; Vout/Iin = 1/R1; missing negative sign."

grounded_guidance: "Cite R1 and the inverting input/output nodes that force the resistor-defined gain."
correctness_reject: "Closed-loop gain without negative sign; magnitude tied to 1/R1."
correctness_guidance: "Penalize for incorrect polarity or magnitude."
