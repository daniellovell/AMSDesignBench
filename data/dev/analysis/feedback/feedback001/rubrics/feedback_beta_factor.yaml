beta_expression_target: "beta = 1 (unity feedback)."
beta_expression_guidance: "Explain that the feedback network directly ties the op-amp output to the summing node, yielding a unity feedback factor."
beta_expression_reject: "beta = 0; beta = R1; beta = 1/R1; no feedback path."

grounded_guidance: "Reference R1 and the op-amp terminals/nets that complete the unity feedback loop."
correctness_reject: "beta = 0; beta = R1; beta = 1/R1; missing unity magnitude."
correctness_guidance: "Deduct for any alternative beta magnitude or statements that break unity feedback."
