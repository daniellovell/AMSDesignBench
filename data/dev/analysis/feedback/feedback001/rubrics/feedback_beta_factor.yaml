weight_beta_expression: "0.70"
weight_grounded_evidence: "0.30"
beta_expression_target: "beta = 1 (unity feedback)."
beta_expression_guidance: "Explain that the feedback network directly ties the op-amp output to the summing node, yielding a unity feedback factor."
beta_expression_reject: "beta = 0; beta = R1; beta = 1/R1; no feedback path."
grounded_min_refs: "2"
grounded_guidance: "Reference R1 and the op-amp terminals/nets that complete the unity feedback loop."
