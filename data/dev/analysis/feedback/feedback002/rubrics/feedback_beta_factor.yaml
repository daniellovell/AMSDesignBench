beta_expression_target: "beta = 1 (unity feedback)."
beta_expression_guidance: "Highlight that the capacitor connects output to summing node, keeping unity feedback."
beta_expression_reject: "beta = 0; beta = C1; beta = 1/C1; no feedback path."

grounded_guidance: "Reference the capacitor and op-amp nodes closing the unity loop."
correctness_reject: "beta set to capacitor impedance or missing unity magnitude."
correctness_guidance: "Deduct when the feedback factor deviates from 1."
