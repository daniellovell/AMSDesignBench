From the {modality} artifact, identify the circuit topology and derive the symbolic transfer function H(s) = Vout(s)/Vin(s).

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Topology
- Transfer function
- Grounded evidence
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Topology: explicitly name the topology (e.g., low-pass RC, high-pass, notch, band-pass, biquad, state-variable) and justify in one sentence using observed connections and element IDs.
- In Transfer function: provide a symbolic H(s) in simplest canonical form, indicating poles/zeros structure (e.g., first-order 1/(1+sRC), second-order normalized form with ω0 and Q, or product of sections if cascaded). Do not plug numeric values.
- In Grounded evidence: cite element IDs and nets from the artifact (e.g., `R1`, `C1`, `L1`, `XU1`, `vout`, `vin`).
- Keep variables symbolic (R, C, L, ω0, Q); avoid numeric substitution.
