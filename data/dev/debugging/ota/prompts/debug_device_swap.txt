You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, diagnose why the OTA shows poor DC bias/low gain.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Symptoms
- Fault
- Grounded evidence
- Fix
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Fault: specific device/structure/motif that is at fault.
- In Grounded evidence: cite the exact element ID and show the problematic line or node context from the artifact.
- In Fix: propose a concrete change and mention any node re-ties needed.

Return markdown only.
