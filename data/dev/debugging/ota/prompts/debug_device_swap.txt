You are an expert analog IC designer.
From the {modality} artifact, diagnose the catastrophic structural failure causing the OTA to show poor DC bias and no gain.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Symptoms
- Fault
- Grounded evidence
- Fix
- Answer

Hard constraints:
- Assume all required bias sources exist and are correctly driven UNLESS the artifact explicitly shows an unconnected bias port or a bias
port tied to an illegal rail (e.g., NMOS gate bias to VDD, PMOS gate bias to GND) OR the bias net is absent from the "nets" list. 
Do NOT claim "missing bias" if a motifâ€™s bias/ gate port is connected to any net typed as "bias".

Guidance:
- In Fault: specific device/structure/motif that is at fault.
- In Grounded evidence: cite the exact element ID and show the problematic line or node context from the artifact.
- In Fix: propose a concrete change and mention any node re-ties needed.
