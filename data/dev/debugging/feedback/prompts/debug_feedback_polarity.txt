You are an expert analog IC designer.
A user reports their feedback amplifier is oscillating or unstable. From the {modality} artifact, diagnose whether the amplifier is in positive or negative feedback and how to fix it.

Required sections (use these exact headers):
- Symptoms
- Fault
- Grounded evidence
- Fix
- Answer

Guidance:
- In Symptoms: describe the behavior expected from the feedback type (positive vs negative).
- In Fault: identify whether the circuit has positive or negative feedback, and whether that is correct.
- In Grounded evidence: cite the exact element IDs and show the problematic connections from the artifact.
- In Fix: propose a concrete change to establish proper negative feedback (e.g., swap opamp inputs, correct resistor connections).
