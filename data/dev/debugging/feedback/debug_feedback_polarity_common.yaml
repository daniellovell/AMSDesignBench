# Common rubric parameters for feedback polarity debugging (Feedback subfamily)

# Weights
weight_fault_identification: 0.40
weight_grounded_evidence: 0.30
weight_fix: 0.20
weight_clarity: 0.10

# fault_identification criterion
fault_identification_section: "Fault"
fault_identification_guidance: "Correctly identify whether the circuit has positive or negative feedback and whether that configuration is correct for the intended circuit."

# grounded_evidence criterion
grounded_evidence_section: "Grounded evidence"
grounded_evidence_guidance: "Cite exact element IDs and problematic node connections from the artifact (e.g., opamp inputs, feedback resistor connections)."
grounded_min_refs: 2

# fix criterion
fix_section: "Fix"
fix_guidance: "Propose concrete change to establish proper negative feedback (e.g., swap opamp inputs, correct resistor node connections)."

# clarity criterion
clarity_section: "Symptoms"
clarity_guidance: "Explain symptoms of positive feedback (instability, oscillation, saturation) and expected behavior with negative feedback."

# Scoring
hallucination_penalty: 0.15
min_pass: 0.70
